I spent so many hours trying to figure out how BitMEX calculate margin/liquidation, etc. and could not find anything out there. I eventually had to dig deep in the code and prepare it for easy use in any Javascript application/ Google Sheets/ etc. This is the most accurate functions and will possibly help you if you building automation bots. If you using any of those in your own Google Sheets or javascript application, please Star or leave a comment to let me know it is useful! Keep Sharing and Make the World a better place !!
